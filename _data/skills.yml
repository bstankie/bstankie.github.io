# Program Champion
- skill: Program Champion
  description: I build cross-functional research programs that require technical and business leadership. These efforts include communication to senior leadership (e.g., CTO, CEO, SVPs) on the vision, opportunity and risks. It also requires a clear, ambitious technical vision that the technical teams can 'see' and become passionate about.

# Technical Leadership
- skill: Technical Leadership
  description: In building a technical vision, I am responsible for understanding the relevant basic, and applied research in the relevant area (usually, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, data science). I am also responsible for leading the intellectual property roadmap that includes evaluating existing intellectual property along with identifying potential opportunities. I have been involved with mergers and acquisitions technical evaluations along with vendor evaluations. I am also responsible for providing 'guard rails' and 'technical paths' to the technical teams as they engage in research & development.

# Team Creation
