# Program Champion
- skill: Program Champion
  description: I build cross-functional research programs that require technical and business leadership. These efforts include communication to senior leadership (e.g., CTO, CEO, SVPs) on the vision, opportunity and risks. It also requires a clear, ambitious technical vision that the technical teams can 'see' and become passionate about.

# Technical Leadership
- skill: Technical Leadership
  description: In building a technical vision, I am responsible for understanding the relevant basic, and applied research in the relevant area (usually, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, data science). I am also responsible for leading the intellectual property roadmap that includes evaluating exising intellectual property along with identifying potential opportunities. I have been involved with mergers and acquistion technical evaluations along with vendor evaluations. I am also responsible for providing 'guard rails' and 'technical paths' to the technical teams as they engage in research & development.

# Team Creation
- skill: Organization Creation
  description: Through program championing, I have been the founder of multiple cross-functional application and research teams through both internal acquisition and external hiring. This started in creating the Shape & Space Lab at the University of Texas, then the AI lab in 3M-Corporate Research Labs, and the Data Science lab in 3M-Health Information Systems.

# Programming skills
- skill: Programming skills
  description: Although I feel that my programming skills are becoming rusty, I work hard to get to the keyboard and program or some full-stack hacking whenever I can (even if it is on my personal time). I feel that it is necessary to keep current so that I do not inadvertently misdirect a technical team and that I can retain credibility when making recommendations. My programming preference is Python, but I also know MatLab and if necessary I could probably still pound something out in Perl. I have recently taught myself React + JavaScript, but would not claim competency. I've worked in AWS and have experience with Azure.
