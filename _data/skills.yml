# Program Champion
- skill: Program Champion
  description: I have built multiple, cross-functional research programs that include technical and business leadership. This has required communication to senior leadership (CTO, CEO, SVPs) on the vision, opportunity and risks along with providing the technical developers a clear, ambitious technical vision that they can become passionate about and is worthy of their valuable time.

# Technical Leadership
- skill: Technical Leadership
  description: In building a technical vision I have been responsible for understanding both the basic research that has been done in the area that would be applicable to a machine learning application and any intellectual property that might be blocking and/or enabling our technology that we might consider licensing. My role as a technical leader is to provide these 'guard rails' and 'technical paths' to the technical teams and to communicate to senior leadership potential risks and opportunities.

# Team Creation
- skill: Organization Creation
  description: Through some program championing, I have created multiple cross-functional application and research teams through both acquisition and hiring. The first was the research lab at the University of Texas, then the AI lab in 3M-CRL and the Data Science lab in 3M-HIS and the Materials Informatics group.

  description: Although I feel that my programming skills are becoming rusty, I work hard to get to the keyboard and do programming or some full-stack hacking whenever I can (even if it is on my personal time). I feel that it is necessary to keep current so that I do not inadvertently misdirect a technical team and that I can retain credibility when making recommendations. My programming preference is Python, but I also know MatLab and if necessary I could probably still pound something out in Perl. I have recently taught myself React + JavaScript, but would not claim competency. I've worked in AWS and have experience with Azure.
